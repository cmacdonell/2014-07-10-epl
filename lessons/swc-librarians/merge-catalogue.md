title: Merging Catalogue Data from Two Files 
---

## Opening
Now that we've learned about loops and opening files, we're going to combine the two to solve a new problem.

##Our new problem
We have two files with different information about books in the database. One file contains information about the number of circulations each item has had, and a second file contains bibliographic information, namely the title and author of each item. 

	The files look like this:

	File 1:
	
	|Item ID | Title | Author |
	|312210121823 | A Canticle for Leibowitz | Walter M. Miller, JR | 
	|312210121212 | Catching Fire | Suzanne Collins | 
	|312210123281 | I, Robot | Isaac Asimov | 
	|312210121314 | The Moon is a Harsh Mistress | Robert A. Heinlein |
